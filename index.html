    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! My name is Mateo, and I am currently finishing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of Oviedo. I come from the lovely region of Asturias.
        
   </p>
        
        <p> I have created this 'blog' with the main purpose of adding details to what is written in my CV.
                The History section is used to provide a more elaborated description of my academic history, but in a relaxed style and filled with personal stories: you should judge it with a sense of humor.
                You can download my CV by clicking on the following button:<form method="get" action="CV.pdf">
                    <button type="submit">  CV  </button> </form>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Moreover, I have added two sections that are going to be more or less personal. In the Writings  section I will be uploading some texts and poems I have written over the years. It is mostly in Spanish, as it is my mother tongue. 
            The Images section will consist of a miscellaneous of pictures taken or produced by me.

    <h2>History</h2>
    
    
    <h4> High School Diploma 2020</h4>

    <p>
      I celebrated my eighteenth birthday two weeks before the quarantine was declared here in Spain mid-March.
    </p>

    <h4> Oxford International Junior Programmes 2018</h4>
<p>
  I had the opportunity to stay for three weeks at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. During that time, we took English classes and there were many group activities. We visited Glasgow and Edinburgh, which I loved. I realized how hard Scottish accent is. 
    I met people from places like Italy, Greece or Chile, as well as from other regions of Spain. A Greek girl and I fell in love with each other. 
    <br> One time playing football, I met a supervisor who was half-Spanish. He told me that the Italians should be easy to beat because he had seen them smoking. 
  

</p>
    
    <h4>Cambridge First Certificate in English 2017</h4>
    <p>I had been taking private classes for about three years, and for the first time ever I had to prove my English knowledge. I hated those classes, but in the end they were extremely useful for my development. 
      <br> For the oral test, I was
      paired with a girl from the same high school. I didn't know her, as she was two years older than me. I had to show her my ID because she wouldn't believe
      I was fifteen years old. Some time later I found her on social media, but unfortunately she had a boyfriend.
